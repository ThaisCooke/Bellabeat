THIS IS THE CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS CERTIFICATE. I CHOSE THE SECOND OPTION, THE BELLABEAT ANALYSIS.

-- I used Excel Spreadsheets for cleaning, SQL for organizing the data and Tableau for Visualization. I used two csv files: sleepDay_merged and 
DailyActivity_merged (which contained Total Steps, Distance, Calories and Amount of Activity)
Excel Spreadsheets was used for removing duplicates, filtering and sorting the data.
For the Daily Steps data, there were some days that recorded steps as 0. This can be due to the user entering the data manually or forgetting to use the device.
Those were removed from the analysis. 



--I did some Data Exploration in SQL. I wanted to find out how many users were on the Daily Activity table, which gave me the result of 33 distinct users:

SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Number_of_users
	FROM dailyactivity;
  
--I did the same for Sleep Day table, which gave me the result of 24 distinct users:

SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Number_of_users
	FROM dailyactivity;

--(That was a problem, since it is not enough sample)

--How many minutes each participant slept:

SELECT Id, SUM(TotalMinutesAsleep)
  FROM sleepDay
  GROUP BY Id 


--How many minutes each participant slept using CTE:

WITH cte_sum_asleep (Id,TotalMinutesAsleep) AS
  (SELECT Id, SUM(TotalMinutesAsleep)
  FROM sleepDay
  GROUP BY Id  )
  SELECT Id, TotalMinutesAsleep
  FROM cte_sum_asleep

--How many calories each participant burned:

SELECT Id, SUM(Calories)
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id
  
-- How many calories each participant burned using CTE:

WITH cte_sum_calories (Id,Calories) AS
  (SELECT Id, SUM(Calories)
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id )
  SELECT Id, calories
  FROM cte_sum_calories
  
--How Many Steps each participant took:

SELECT Id, COUNT (TotalSteps)
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id

--How many Steps each participant took using CTE:

WITH cte_sum_steps (Id,TotalSteps) AS
  (SELECT Id, SUM(TotalSteps)
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id )
  SELECT Id, TotalSteps
  FROM cte_sum_steps


--Relation Between Steps and Calories Burned:

SELECT Id, SUM(TotalSteps) AS Total_Steps, SUM (Calories) AS Total_Calories
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id
  
--I wanted to see if there was a correlation between sleeping and number of calories burned using inner join:

SELECT DailyActivity.Id, SUM (sleepDay.TotalMinutesAsleep) AS TotalMinutesAsleep, SUM (dailyActivity.calories) AS TotalCalories
	FROM DailyActivity
	INNER JOIN SleepDay 
	on dailyActivity.Id = sleepDay.Id 
	GROUP BY dailyActivity.Id


--Also, I wanted to put together a full table between amount of sleep and amount of exercise also using inner join (minutes asleep vs active or sedentary):

SELECT
  DailyActivity.VeryActiveMinutes,
  DailyActivity.FairlyActiveMinutes,
  DailyActivity.LightlyActiveMinutes,
  DailyActivity.SedentaryMinutes,
  DailyActivity.Calories,
  sleepDay.TotalMinutesAsleep
  FROM dailyActivity
  INNER JOIN SleepDay
  on dailyActivity.Id = sleepDay.Id
  
--For finding activity level, number of Steps and calories burnt

SELECT ID, SUM(TotalSteps) AS TotalSteps, SUM(Calories) AS Calories, SUM(VeryActiveMinutes) AS VeryActiveMinutes, 
SUM(FairlyActiveMinutes) AS FairlyActiveMinutes, SUM(LightlyActiveMinutes) AS LightActiveMinutes, SUM(SedentaryMinutes) AS SedentaryMinutes
FROM dailyActivity
WHERE VeryActiveDistance+ModeratelyActiveDistance+LightActiveDistance <> 0 AND VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes <> 0
GROUP BY Id


--Amount of activity per day per participant in minutes: 

SELECT Id, SUM (VeryActiveMinutes) AS VeryActive, SUM (FairlyActiveMinutes) AS FairlyActive, 
SUM (LightlyActiveMinutes) AS LightlyActive, SUM (SedentaryMinutes) AS Sedentary
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id


--Total Intensity:


  SELECT Id, SUM (VeryActiveMinutes) + SUM (LightlyActiveMinutes) + SUM (FairlyActiveMinutes) + SUM (SedentaryMinutes) AS Total_Intensity
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id


-- Average Intensity:

SELECT Id, AVG (VeryActiveMinutes) + AVG (LightlyActiveMinutes) + AVG (FairlyActiveMinutes) + AVG (SedentaryMinutes) AS Total_Intensity
  FROM dailyActivity
  GROUP BY Id





NEXT: AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY PER DAY (Sedentary, very active, etc) IN PERCENTAGE (check those codes tomorrow)

??SELECT VeryActiveMinutes, count(*) * 100.0 / (select count(*) from dailyActivity) AS Activity_percentage
from dailyActivity
GROUP BY VeryActiveMinutes??

??SELECT Id, SUM(VeryActiveMinutes) AS VeryActiveMinutes
FROM dailyActivity
GROUP BY Id 

WITH cte_sum_veryactive (Id, VeryActiveMinutes) AS
(SELECT Id, SUM(VeryActiveMinutes)
FROM dailyActivity
GROUP BY Id)
SELECT Id, VeryActiveMinutes/ 1440 
FROM cte_sum_veryactive??
